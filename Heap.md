# Heap

1. Recall heap sort alg: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/, heapify(recursively make a tree rooted at i binary heap): at i, compare with child node of i and float largest up, this make sure i is larger than its child, but swap might break child tree invariant thus continue heapify on swapped up original pos child node. And then we do heapify from end to start of array, (only need to start from half pos and continue to first since later node are leaf nodes) and we fix invariant along the way if smaller go down. Then we get a whole tree as a binary max heap. Then we do sorting: take out max, and try to heapify from begin again but we have no node at begin so we take one leaf node (won't break invariant since this node has no child) to place at root and do heapify. And we get a bianry heap again, we do the process again and again until all nodes were taken and we sorted the array. (Python heapq do that in-place. heapq.heapop, need to do heapq.heapify if list is not a heap already)
